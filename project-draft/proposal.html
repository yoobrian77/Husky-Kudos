        <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><em>Topic / Question of Interest:</em> Can we give recognition to students and faculty at the University of Washington who display acts aligning with the school's values?   Living by the school values: Integrity, Diversity, Excellence, Collaboration, Innovation and Respect, should be encouraged and applauded and we believe our website will be a stepping stone in making that a possibility.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Information Technology Problem In This Space:</em> There is no centralized way through information technologies to know or recognize which students are living by the schoolâ€™s values. It is impossible to monitor every UW student to see if they are living by UW's values. The best we can do is to promote lifestyles based on these values. There aren't many UW specific information technologies that allow students and faculty to "shout out" an individual based on something they did. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><em>Previous Attempts to Solve This Problem:</em> There is currently a website called <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/">ratemyprofessors.com</a> that allows students to review professors. These reviews can have both positive and negative commentary.
                There is also a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.washington.edu/husky100/">Husky 100</a> list that recognizes and displays 100 students at UW who have made the most out of their time. This list focuses more on academic and professional success and a committee chooses who deserves to be on the list. Rather than just every student nominated getting a place on the site. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>We would like our users to view information relating to all the shoutouts that have been posted onto the dashboard by other students and faculty. For our application we hope to gain access to the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/home/peopledir/?method=mail&term=agg" target="_blank">UW Active directory</a> databse so that students and faculty could be easily looked up. If that is not possible, to will create our own directory.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Our web-app is intended to create a space for students and faculty to recognize one another for adhering to UW principles. By bringing recognition to individuals in the UW community we hope to increase student and faculty satisfaction and build a stronger community.</li>
