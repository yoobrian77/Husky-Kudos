                        <p>Can we give recognition to students and faculty at the University of Washington who display acts aligning with the school's values? </p> 
                        <p> The school values: Integrity, Diversity, Excellence, Collaboration, Innovation and Respect, should be encouraged and applauded and we believe our website will be a stepping stone in making that a possibility.</p>
                        <p>Our web-app is intended to create a space for students and faculty to recognize one another for adhering to UW principles. By bringing recognition to individuals in the UW community we hope to increase student and faculty satisfaction and build a stronger community.</p>
